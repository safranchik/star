"Study finds fish preserve DNA 'memories' far better than humans - University of Otago researchers report that memory in the form of 'DNA methylation' is preserved between generations of fish, in contrast to humans where this is almost entirely erased.",1967,0,1
"Greenland ice sheet shrinks by record amount. Greenland lost around 600 billion tonnes of water last year, an amount that would contribute about 1.5 millimetres of sea level rise. Greenland contributed 20-25% of global sea level rise over the last few decades",322,9,0
"Climate change is making stronger El Ninos, which change weather worldwide and heat up an already warming planet, a new study finds",814,9,0
"A large randomized study published Sunday finds that 70% of women with early-stage invasive breast cancer no longer need chemotherapy, using the results of a commonly used genomic test. This practice-changing finding will spare a lot of unnecessary chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.",3394,4,1
According to a statistical analysis finding cosmic H2O may not be all that difficult outside our own solar system. Simulations based on exoplanet data suggest water worlds covered with deep oceans may actually be rather common throughout our galaxy.,112,2,0

"Ants are “immune” to traffic jams, suggests new study. Even in crowded conditions, ant colonies still manage to maintain smooth traffic flow. Unlike self-interested humans, ants have a common goal, the colony's survival. This may be why just widening highways doesn't reduce human traffic congestion.",11896,3,1

"Drops in income may not only hurt the wallet, they may harm the brain, suggests a new study. Young adults who experience unsteady income, with annual income drops of 25% or more, may be more at risk of having thinking problems and reduced brain health in middle age (n=3,287, ages 23 to 35).",1759,15,1
